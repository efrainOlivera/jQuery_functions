Assignment: jQuery Functions

Create a web page that uses the following jQuery functions: Don't randomly start writing jQuery and find elements to attach jQuery code to. Think about what each function could be useful for! This is an assignment that previous students have often reverted back to so as to brush up on their jQuery in later weeks! Use the mockup as motivation, but feel free to embellish!
